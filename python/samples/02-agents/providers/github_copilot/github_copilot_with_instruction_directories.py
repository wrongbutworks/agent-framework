GitHub Copilot Agent with Instruction Directories

This sample demonstrates how to configure custom instruction directories with
GitHubCopilotAgent. Instruction directories let the CLI load project-specific
or team-shared instruction files that shape the agent's behavior beyond the
default system message.

Use cases:
- Point the agent at a team-shared set of coding conventions.
- Load project-specific guidelines from a local `.copilot/instructions/` folder.
- Override or augment default instructions per session at runtime.

Environment variables (optional):
- GITHUB_COPILOT_CLI_PATH - Path to the Copilot CLI executable
- GITHUB_COPILOT_MODEL - Model to use (e.g., "gpt-5", "claude-sonnet-4")
