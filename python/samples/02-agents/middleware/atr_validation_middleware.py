"""
Deterministic validation at the tool-execution boundary (issue #5366).

This sample shows the pattern recommended in #5366: a single, deterministic enforcement
point that validates a tool call right before it executes. ATRValidationMiddleware is a
FunctionMiddleware that inspects the validated tool arguments in
``FunctionInvocationContext.arguments`` and raises ``MiddlewareTermination`` BEFORE calling
``call_next()`` when the arguments match a known attack pattern, so the tool never runs.

Detection is delegated to Agent Threat Rules (ATR) -- an open, MIT-licensed detection ruleset
for AI-agent threats such as prompt injection, tool-argument tampering, and exfiltration. The
sample loads the published ruleset (``pip install pyatr``) and runs the real engine over the tool
arguments. ``pyatr`` evaluates the rules locally and deterministically, with no model call in the
enforcement path, so the block/allow decision is reproducible and auditable. See
https://github.com/Agent-Threat-Rule/agent-threat-rules.

    sorts matches critical-first, so the first rule id is the highest-severity hit.

    The ruleset replaces a hand-rolled deny-list. For reference, the shape of the patterns ATR
    encodes (and that the earlier version of this sample inlined) is, e.g.::

        ignore (previous|prior|above) instructions        # instruction override / prompt injection

    straight-line call instead of a local regex list.
