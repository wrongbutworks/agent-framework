"""Single Agent Streaming Sample - Durable Task Integration (Combined Worker + Client)
This sample demonstrates running both the worker and client in a single process
with reliable Redis-based streaming for agent responses.
The worker is started first to register the TravelPlanner agent with Redis streaming
callback, then client operations are performed against the running worker.
Prerequisites:
- Set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT and FOUNDRY_MODEL
- Sign in with Azure CLI for AzureCliCredential authentication
- Durable Task Scheduler must be running (e.g., using Docker)
- Redis must be running (e.g., docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:latest)
To run this sample:
    python sample.py
