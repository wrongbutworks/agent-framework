"""Multi-Agent Orchestration with Conditionals Sample - Durable Task Integration

This sample demonstrates conditional orchestration logic with two agents:
- SpamDetectionAgent: Analyzes emails for spam content
- EmailAssistantAgent: Drafts professional responses to legitimate emails

The orchestration branches based on spam detection results, calling different
activity functions to handle spam or send legitimate email responses.

Prerequisites:
- Set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT and AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL
- Sign in with Azure CLI for AzureCliCredential authentication
- Durable Task Scheduler must be running (e.g., using Docker)

To run this sample:
    python sample.py
