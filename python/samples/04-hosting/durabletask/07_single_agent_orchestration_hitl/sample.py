"""Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration Sample - Durable Task Integration
This sample demonstrates the HITL pattern with a WriterAgent that generates content
and waits for human approval. The orchestration handles:
- External event waiting (approval/rejection)
- Timeout handling
- Iterative refinement based on feedback
- Activity functions for notifications and publishing
Prerequisites:
- Set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT and FOUNDRY_MODEL
- Sign in with Azure CLI for AzureCliCredential authentication
- Durable Task Scheduler must be running (e.g., using Docker)
To run this sample:
    python sample.py
