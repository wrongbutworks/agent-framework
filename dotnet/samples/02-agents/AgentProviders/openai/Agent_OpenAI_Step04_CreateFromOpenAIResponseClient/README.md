# Creating an Agent from an OpenAIResponseClient

This sample demonstrates how to create an AI agent directly from an `OpenAI.Responses.OpenAIResponseClient` instance using the `OpenAIResponseClientAgent` class.

## What This Sample Shows

- **Direct OpenAIResponseClient Creation**: Shows how to create an `OpenAI.Responses.OpenAIResponseClient` from `OpenAI.OpenAIClient` and then use it to instantiate an agent
- **OpenAIResponseClientAgent**: Demonstrates using the OpenAI SDK primitives instead of the ones from Microsoft.Extensions.AI and Microsoft.Agents.AI abstractions
- **Full Agent Capabilities**: Shows both regular and streaming invocation of the agent

## Running the Sample

1. Set the required environment variables:
   ```bash
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   set OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_NAME=gpt-5.4-mini
   ```

2. Run the sample:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
