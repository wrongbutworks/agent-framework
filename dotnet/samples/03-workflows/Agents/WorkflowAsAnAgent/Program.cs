/// <summary>
/// This sample introduces the concept of workflows as agents, where a workflow can be
/// treated as an <see cref="AIAgent"/>. This allows you to interact with a workflow
/// as if it were a single agent.
///
/// In this example, we create a workflow that uses two language agents to process
/// input concurrently, one that responds in French and another that responds in English.
///
/// You will interact with the workflow in an interactive loop, sending messages and receiving
/// streaming responses from the workflow as if it were an agent who responds in both languages.
///
/// This sample also demonstrates <see cref="IResettableExecutor"/>, which is required
/// for stateful executors that are shared across multiple workflow runs. Each iteration
/// of the interactive loop triggers a new workflow run against the same workflow instance.
/// Between runs, the framework automatically calls <see cref="IResettableExecutor.ResetAsync"/>
/// on shared executors so that accumulated state (e.g., collected messages) is cleared
/// before the next run begins. See <c>WorkflowFactory.ConcurrentAggregationExecutor</c>
/// for the implementation.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Pre-requisites:
/// - Foundational samples should be completed first.
/// - This sample uses concurrent processing.
/// - An Azure OpenAI endpoint and deployment name.
/// </remarks>
